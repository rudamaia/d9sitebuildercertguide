# Paths, Aliases, and URLs

### What is a URL?

URL is the abbreviation for "Uniform Resource Locator", which is the pageâ€™s address on the web. It is the "name" by which a browser identifies a page to display. In the example "Visit us at _example.com_.", _example.com_ is the URL for the home page of your website. Users use URLs to locate content on the web.

### What is a Path?

A path is the unique, last part of the URL for a specific function or piece of content. For example, for a page whose full URL is _http://example.com/node/7_, the path is _node/7_.

Here are some examples of paths you might find in your site:

*   _node/7_
*   _taxonomy/term/6_
*   _admin/content/comment_
*   _user/login_
*   _user/3_

### What is an Alias?

The core software has a feature called "URL Alias" that allows you to provide a more understandable name to the content. So, if you have an "About Us" page with the path _node/7_, you can set up an alias so that your visitors will see it as _http://www.example.com/AboutUs_. The core Path module, which supports URL aliasing, provides this functionality.
