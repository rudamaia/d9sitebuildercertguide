The certification track points us to "Identify performance issues resulting from site configuration" meaning that any performance issue not config related will not be approached in this exam. The only things that can be approached as far as configuration goes:

# Cron
[Cron](terminology.md#cron) jobs are the basic maintenance tasks needed in any Drupal site. Making sure it runs periodically can be pointed as a performance benefit as well.

# Cache
Pretty much obvious, the Drupal [Caching](terminology.md#cache) Ability is the main performance issue to be aproached.

# Bandwidth optimization
External resources can be optimized automatically, which can reduce both the size and number of requests made to your website. [Aggregate CSS files and JavaScript files](https://i.imgur.com/BNUVyXh.jpeg) will improove performance as well.
